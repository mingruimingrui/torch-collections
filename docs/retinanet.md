## torch_collections.models.RetinaNet

The `RetinaNet` is a state of the art object detection model, implemented based on [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002).

A pretrained model trained on the coco dataset can be downloaded from this repository's [release page](https://github.com/mingruimingrui/torch-collections/releases).

This page serves as a documentation for the various functionalities of this implementation of `RetinaNet`.
