__torch-collections__ is a collection of popular deep learning models that uses the torch high-level APIs. These models are intended for fast iterative train-test cycles.

Most models are implemented based on their papers but additional options are inserted to improve customizability and the codebase are optimized for fast performance. Some pretrained models are provided for the popular open-source datasets.
